	abstract = {The {ERP} components and variations of spatial complexity or functional connectivity are two distinct dimensions of neurophysiological events in the visual Go/Nogo task. Extensive studies have been conducted on these two distinct dimensions; however, no study has investigated whether these two neurophysiological events are linked to each other in the visual Go/Nogo task. The relationship between spatial complexity of electroencephalographic ({EEG}) data, quantified by the measure omega complexity, and event-related potential ({ERP}) components in a visual Go/Nogo task was studied. We found that with the increase of spatial complexity level, the latencies of N1 and N2 component were shortened and the amplitudes of N1, N2, and P3 components were decreased. The anterior Go/Nogo N2 effect and the Go/Nogo P3 effect were also found to be decreased with the increase of {EEG} spatial complexity. In addition, the reaction times in high spatial complexity trials were significantly shorter than those of medium and low spatial complexity trials when the time interval used to estimate the {EEG} spatial complexity was extended to 0∼1,000 ms after stimulus onset. These results suggest that high spatial complexity may be associated with faster cognitive processing and smaller postsynaptic potentials that occur simultaneously in large numbers of cortical pyramidal cells of certain brain regions. The {EEG} spatial complexity is closely related with demands of certain cognitive processes and the neural processing efficiency of human brain.
{NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY}: The reaction times, the latencies/amplitudes of event-related potential ({ERP}) components, the Go/Nogo N2 effect, and the Go/Nogo P3 effect are linked to the electroencephalographic ({EEG}) spatial complexity level. The {EEG} spatial complexity is closely related to demands of certain cognitive processes and could reflect the neural processing efficiency of human brain. Obtaining the single-trial {ERP} features through single-trial spatial complexity may be a more efficient approach than traditional methods.},

It analyzes certain human states recorded by Electroencephalograhy ({EEG}) during playing computer games activity. However, the classification procedure was offline, thus the recording and analysis will not interfere/disturb the game player. From that recording, it was possible to differentiate certain player states. The games used for the experiment were different challenges in racing games and first person shooter with different types of difficulty levels. The acquired data was preprocessed to remove mostly eye movement artifacts. Then, several features were extracted mostly related to the time and frequency domain of the signal. In this experiment, {EEG} analysis was done in which two stress levels were compared viz., excited state and relaxed state.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate behavioral and electrophysiological indices of developing response activation and inhibition processes in child, young-adult, and adult groups. Sixty subjects, with 20 in each of the child (mean age 10.8 years), young-adult (mean age 20.7 years), and older adult (mean age 36.4 years) groups, performed an auditory Go/{NoGo} task while task performance variables and {EEG} were recorded. {ERPs} were derived to Go (response activation) and {NoGo} (response inhibition) stimuli, with the amplitude and latency of the N1, P2, N2, and P3 {ERP} components analyzed as a function of age. Results indicate improved task performance, and a reduction in the latency of each component and the amplitude of the N2 and P3 components, with increasing age. Analyses of Go versus {NoGo} effects indicated differential utilization of inhibition-related processing stages in children compared to adults, with some minor differences between the two adult groups. Go/{NoGo} effects were evident during early stages of processing, such as those indexed by the N1 and N2 components in children, but only in later stages, as indexed by P3, in adult subjects. This study provides much-needed data on the normative development of response activation and inhibition, as operationalized by the auditory Go/{NoGo} task, in children and two groups of younger/older adult subjects.},

	abstract = {Prior Go/{NoGo} studies have localized specific regions and {EEG} spectra for which traditional approaches have distinguished between Go and {NoGo} conditions. A more detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and timing of the synchronization of frequency bands would contribute substantially to the clarification of neural mechanisms that underlie performance of the Go/{NoGo} task. The present study used a machine learning approach to learn the features that distinguish between {ERSPs} involved in selection and inhibition in a Go/{NoGo} task. A neural network classifier was used to predict task conditions for each subject to characterize {ERSPs} associated with Go versus {NoGo} trials. The final model accurately identified individual task conditions at an overall rate of 92\%, estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The detailed accounting of {EEG} time-frequency patterns localized to brain sources (i.e., thalamus, {preSMA}, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex) provides elaboration on previous findings from {fMRI} and {EEG} studies and more information about {EEG} power changes in multiple frequency bands (i.e., primarily theta power increase, alpha decreases, and beta increases and decreases) within these regions underlying the selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and {NoGo} trials. This extends previous findings, providing more information about neural mechanisms underlying selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and {NoGo} trials, respectively, and may offer insight into therapeutic uses of neuromodulation in neural dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of operator Cognitive Task Load ({CTL}) level is quite crucial in Human-Machine ({HM}) collaborative task environment since operator mental overload or inattention caused by abnormal {CTL} states may lead to human performance degradation or even catastrophic accidents. One of the most practical approaches tackling this issue is to use ongoing electroencephalogram ({EEG}) in which human cognitive state can be objectively estimated. However, the accurate recognition of {CTL} via single channel {EEG} with the lowest-intrusivity to task condition is particularly challenging as {EEG} is characterized by individual dependency and nonstationarity. In this paper, a deep learning model designed by Stacked Denoising {AutoEncoder} ({SDAE}) is employed on single {EEG} channel signal to estimate binary levels (low vs. high) of {CTL}. By adopting a simulated {HM} process control system, the operator {EEG} data for 8 healthy subjects under different task demands were collected on two experimental sessions across two consecutive days. Based on the computed full power spectral of {EEG}. the number of nodes in {SDAE} is determined by greedy search according to the optimal training error of each layer. The shallow layers of the designed deep network are used to extract the subject-specific information related to {CTL} variation while the stable power features were reconstructed in those deep layers. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated to be effective and 74\% classification rate across sessions in average of all subjects were achieved.},

	abstract = {This experiment was designed to distinguish possible {EEG} correlates of the cognitive components of tasks from {EEG} patterns associated with stimulus characteristics, limb and eye movements, and performance-related factors such as subjects' ability and effort. Thirty-two right-handed adults each performed 30 trials, lasting 6–15 sec each, of four simplified, controlled tasks: mental rotation of geometric forms, serial addition of a column of signed digits, substitution of letters with subsequent word recognition and visual fixation. The first three tasks could not be differentiated from each other. Each of these tasks could be differentiated from visual fixation by approximately 10\% generalized reductions in alpha and beta band intensities, and slight increases in theta band intensities frontally and occipitally. We conclude that the {EEG} patterns which differentiated the complex tasks described in Part I were due to inter-task differences in stimulus characteristics, efferent activities and/or performance-related factors, rather than to cognitive differences. With these controls, no evidence for lateralization of different types of cognitive activity was found in the {EEG}.
Résumé
Cette expérimentation a été faite pour distinguer les corrélats {EEG} de la composante cognitive des tâches des patterns {EEG} liés aux caractéristiques du stimulus, aux mouvements des membres et des yeux, et aux facteurs liés à la performance tels que les aptitudes et les efforts des sujets. Trente-deux adultes droitiers ont réalisé chacun 30 passages, durant de 6 à 15 secondes chacun, de 4 tâches simplifiées et contrôlées: rotation mentale de formes géométriques, addition sérielle d'une colonne de chiffres, substitution de lettres suivie de reconnaissance du mot, fixation visuelle. Les trois premières tâches ne peuvent pas être différenciées l'une de l'autre. Chacune de ces tâches peut se différencier de la fixation visuelle par une réduction généralisée d'environ 10\% des intensités de la bande alpha et bêta et une légère augmentation d'intensité de la bande thêta dans les régions frontale et occipitale. Les auteurs concluent que les patterns {EEG} qui différencient les tâches complexes décrites dans la première partie sont dues à des différences inter-tâches des caractéristiques du stimulus, des activités afférentes et/ou des facteurs liés à la performance, et non à des différences cognitives. Compte-tenu de ces contrôles, aucun signe de latéralisation de ces différents types d'activités cognitives n'a été observé à l'{EEG}.},

With the emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAV}), the ability to acquire spatial data at the desired spatial and temporal resolution became available, and the resulting input data met high standards for weed management. In this paper, we tested four independent classification algorithms for the creation of weed maps, combining automatic and manual methods, as well as object-based and pixel-based classification approaches, which were used separately on two subsets. Input {UAV} data were collected using a low-cost {RGB} camera due to its affordability compared to multispectral cameras. Classification algorithms were based on the random forest machine learning algorithm for weed and bare soil extraction, following an unsupervised classification with the K-means algorithm for further estimation of weeds and bare soil presence in non-weed and non-soil areas. Of the four classification algorithms tested, the automatic object-based classification method achieved the highest classification accuracy, resulting in an overall accuracy of 89.0\% for subset A and 87.1\% for subset B. Automatic classification methods were robustly developed, using at least 0.25\% of the scene size as the training data set in all circumstances anticipated for the random forest classification algorithm to operate. The use of the algorithm resulted in weed maps consisting of zoned classes and covering areas with similar biological properties, making them ready for use as inputs in weed treatments that use agricultural machinery.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Spatial-explicit weed information is critical for controlling weed infestation and reducing corn yield losses. The development of unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV})-based remote sensing presents an unprecedented opportunity for efficient, timely weed mapping. Spectral, textural, and structural measurements have been used for weed mapping, whereas thermal measurements—for example, canopy temperature ({CT})—were seldom considered and used. In this study, we quantified the optimal combination of spectral, textural, structural, and {CT} measurements based on different machine-learning algorithms for weed mapping. {RESULTS} {CT} improved weed-mapping accuracies as complementary information for spectral, textural, and structural features (up to 5\% and 0.051 improvements in overall accuracy [{OA}] and Marco-F1, respectively). The fusion of textural, structural, and thermal features achieved the best performance in weed mapping ({OA} = 96.4\%, Marco-F1 = 0.964), followed by the fusion of structural and thermal features ({OA} = 93.6\%, Marco-F1 = 0.936). The Support Vector Machine-based model achieved the best performance in weed mapping, with 3.5\% and 7.1\% improvements in {OA} and 0.036 and 0.071 in Marco-F1 respectively, compared with the best models of Random Forest and Naïve Bayes Classifier. {CONCLUSION} Thermal measurement can complement other types of remote-sensing measurements and improve the weed-mapping accuracy within the data-fusion framework. Importantly, integrating textural, structural, and thermal features achieved the best performance for weed mapping. Our study provides a novel method for weed mapping using {UAV}-based multisource remote sensing measurements, which is critical for ensuring crop production in precision agriculture. © 2023 The Authors.

This is because the reliability of cost estimates and under-sampling have not been determined. We provide the first detailed analysis of the reported costs associated with invasive species to the Australian economy since the 1960s, based on the recently published {InvaCost} database and supplementary information, for a total of 2078 unique cost entries.

However, this is an underestimate given that costs rise as the number of estimates increases following a power law. There was an average 1.8–6.3-fold increase in the total costs per decade since the 1970s to the present, producing estimated costs of {US}6.09–57.91billionyear−1(allcostscombined){orUS}6.09–57.91billionyear−1(allcostscombined){orUS}6.09–57.91 billion year-1 (all costs combined) or {US}225.31 million–6.84 billion year-1 (observed, highly reliable costs only).

The four costliest classes were mammals ({US}48.63 billion), insects ({US}11.95billion),eudicots({US}11.95billion),eudicots({US}11.95 billion), eudicots ({US}4.10 billion) and monocots ({US}\$1.92 billion). The three costliest species were all animals – cats (Felis catus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). Each State/Territory had a different suite of major costs by species, but with most (3–62\%) costs derived from one to three species per political unit. Most (61\%) of the reported costs applied to multiple environments and 73\% of the total pertained to direct damage or loss compared to management costs only, with both of these findings reflecting the availability of data. Rising incursions of invasive species will continue to have substantial costs for the Australian economy, but with better investment, standardised assessments and reporting and coordinated interventions (including eradications), some of these costs could be substantially reduced.},

	abstract = {Near earth sensing from uncrewed aerial vehicles or {UAVs} has emerged as a potential approach for fine-scale environmental monitoring. These systems provide a cost-effective and repeatable means to acquire remotely sensed images in unprecedented spatial detail and a high signal-to-noise ratio. It is increasingly possible to obtain both physiochemical and structural insights into the environment using state-of-art light detection and ranging ({LiDAR}) sensors integrated onto {UAVs}. Monitoring sensitive environments, such as swamp vegetation in longwall mining areas, is essential yet challenging due to their inherent complexities. Current practices for monitoring these remote and challenging environments are primarily ground-based. This is partly due to an absent framework and challenges of using {UAV}-based sensor systems in monitoring such sensitive environments. This research addresses the related challenges in developing a {LiDAR} system, including a workflow for mapping and potentially monitoring highly heterogeneous and complex environments. This involves amalgamating several design components, including hardware integration, calibration of sensors, mission planning, and developing a processing chain to generate usable datasets. It also includes the creation of new methodologies and processing routines to establish a pipeline for efficient data retrieval and generation of usable products. The designed systems and methods were applied to a peat swamp environment to obtain an accurate geo-spatialised {LiDAR} point cloud. Performance of the {LiDAR} data was tested against ground-based measurements on various aspects, including visual assessment for generation {LiDAR} metrices maps, canopy height model, and fine-scale mapping.},
