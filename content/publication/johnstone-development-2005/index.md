abstract: . The aim of the present study was to investigate behavioral and electrophysiological
  indices of developing response activation and inhibition processes in child, young-adult,
  and adult groups. Sixty subjects, with 20 in each of the child (mean age 10.8 years),
  young-adult (mean age 20.7 years), and older adult (mean age 36.4 years) groups,
  performed an auditory Go/NoGo task while task performance variables and EEG were
  recorded. ERPs were derived to Go (response activation) and NoGo (response inhibition)
  stimuli, with the amplitude and latency of the N1, P2, N2, and P3 ERP components
  analyzed as a function of age. Results indicate improved task performance, and a
  reduction in the latency of each component and the amplitude of the N2 and P3 components,
  with increasing age. Analyses of Go versus NoGo effects indicated differential utilization
  of inhibition-related processing stages in children compared to adults, with some
  minor differences between the two adult groups. Go/NoGo effects were evident during
  early stages of processing, such as those indexed by the N1 and N2 components in
  children, but only in later stages, as indexed by P3, in adult subjects. This study
  provides much-needed data on the normative development of response activation and
  inhibition, as operationalized by the auditory Go/NoGo task, in children and two
  groups of younger/older adult subjects.
