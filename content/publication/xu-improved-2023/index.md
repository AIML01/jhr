abstract: BACKGROUND Spatial-explicit weed information is critical for controlling
  weed infestation and reducing corn yield losses. The development of unmanned aerial
  vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing presents an unprecedented opportunity for efficient,
  timely weed mapping. Spectral, textural, and structural measurements have been used
  for weed mapping, whereas thermal measurements—for example, canopy temperature (CT)—were
  seldom considered and used. In this study, we quantified the optimal combination
  of spectral, textural, structural, and CT measurements based on different machine-learning
  algorithms for weed mapping. RESULTS CT improved weed-mapping accuracies as complementary
  information for spectral, textural, and structural features (up to 5% and 0.051
  improvements in overall accuracy [OA] and Marco-F1, respectively). The fusion of
  textural, structural, and thermal features achieved the best performance in weed
  mapping (OA = 96.4%, Marco-F1 = 0.964), followed by the fusion of structural and
  thermal features (OA = 93.6%, Marco-F1 = 0.936). The Support Vector Machine-based
  model achieved the best performance in weed mapping, with 3.5% and 7.1% improvements
  in OA and 0.036 and 0.071 in Marco-F1 respectively, compared with the best models
  of Random Forest and Naïve Bayes Classifier. CONCLUSION Thermal measurement can
  complement other types of remote-sensing measurements and improve the weed-mapping
  accuracy within the data-fusion framework. Importantly, integrating textural, structural,
  and thermal features achieved the best performance for weed mapping. Our study provides
  a novel method for weed mapping using UAV-based multisource remote sensing measurements,
  which is critical for ensuring crop production in precision agriculture. © 2023
