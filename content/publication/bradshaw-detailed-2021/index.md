abstract: The legacy of deliberate and accidental introductions of invasive alien
  species to Australia has had a hefty economic toll, yet quantifying the magnitude
  of the costs associated with direct loss and damage, as well as for management interventions,
  remains elusive. This is because the reliability of cost estimates and under-sampling
  have not been determined. We provide the first detailed analysis of the reported
  costs associated with invasive species to the Australian economy since the 1960s,
  based on the recently published InvaCost database and supplementary information,
  for a total of 2078 unique cost entries. Since the 1960s, Australia has spent or
  incurred losses totalling at least US298.58billion(2017value)orAU298.58billion(2017value)orAU298.58
  billion (2017 value) or AU389.59 billion (2017 average exchange rate) from invasive
  species. However, this is an underestimate given that costs rise as the number of
  estimates increases following a power law. There was an average 1.8–6.3-fold increase
  in the total costs per decade since the 1970s to the present, producing estimated
  costs of 
  US6.09–57.91billionyear−1(allcostscombined)orUS6.09–57.91billionyear−1(allcostscombined)orUS6.09–57.91
  billion year-1 (all costs combined) or US225.31 million–6.84 billion year-1 (observed,
  highly reliable costs only). Costs arising from plant species were the highest among
  kingdoms 
  (US151.68billion),althoughmostofthecostswerenotattributabletosinglespecies.Oftheidentifiedweedyspecies,thecostliestwereannualryegrass(Loliumrigidum),parthenium(Partheniumhysterophorus)andragwort(Seneciojacobaea).Thefourcostliestclassesweremammals(US151.68billion),althoughmostofthecostswerenotattributabletosinglespecies.Oftheidentifiedweedyspecies,thecostliestwereannualryegrass(Loliumrigidum),parthenium(Partheniumhysterophorus)andragwort(Seneciojacobaea).Thefourcostliestclassesweremammals(US151.68
  billion), although most of the costs were not attributable to single species. Of
  the identified weedy species, the costliest were annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum),
  parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) and ragwort (Senecio jacobaea). The four costliest
  classes were mammals (US48.63 billion), insects (US11.95billion),eudicots(US11.95billion),eudicots(US11.95
  billion), eudicots (US4.10 billion) and monocots (US$1.92 billion). The three costliest
  species were all animals – cats (Felis catus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and
  red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). Each State/Territory had a different
  suite of major costs by species, but with most (3–62%) costs derived from one to
  three species per political unit. Most (61%) of the reported costs applied to multiple
  environments and 73% of the total pertained to direct damage or loss compared to
  management costs only, with both of these findings reflecting the availability of
  data. Rising incursions of invasive species will continue to have substantial costs
  for the Australian economy, but with better investment, standardised assessments
  and reporting and coordinated interventions (including eradications), some of these
  costs could be substantially reduced.
