abstract: In today's world, game playing is seen in almost all the ages as well as
  it is having big market. The goal of this work was to analyze the stress level of
  a human player during gaming session. It analyzes certain human states recorded
  by Electroencephalograhy (EEG) during playing computer games activity. However,
  the classification procedure was offline, thus the recording and analysis will not
  interfere/disturb the game player. From that recording, it was possible to differentiate
  certain player states. The games used for the experiment were different challenges
  in racing games and first person shooter with different types of difficulty levels.
  The acquired data was preprocessed to remove mostly eye movement artifacts. Then,
  several features were extracted mostly related to the time and frequency domain
  of the signal. In this experiment, EEG analysis was done in which two stress levels
  were compared viz., excited state and relaxed state.
