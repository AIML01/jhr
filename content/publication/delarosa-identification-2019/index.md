abstract: Prior Go/NoGo studies have localized specific regions and EEG spectra for
  which traditional approaches have distinguished between Go and NoGo conditions.
  A more detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and timing of the synchronization
  of frequency bands would contribute substantially to the clarification of neural
  mechanisms that underlie performance of the Go/NoGo task. The present study used
  a machine learning approach to learn the features that distinguish between ERSPs
  involved in selection and inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. A neural network classifier
  was used to predict task conditions for each subject to characterize ERSPs associated
  with Go versus NoGo trials. The final model accurately identified individual task
  conditions at an overall rate of 92%, estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The
  detailed accounting of EEG time-frequency patterns localized to brain sources (i.e.,
  thalamus, preSMA, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex) provides elaboration
  on previous findings from fMRI and EEG studies and more information about EEG power
  changes in multiple frequency bands (i.e., primarily theta power increase, alpha
  decreases, and beta increases and decreases) within these regions underlying the
  selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials. This extends
  previous findings, providing more information about neural mechanisms underlying
  selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials, respectively,
  and may offer insight into therapeutic uses of neuromodulation in neural dysfunction.
