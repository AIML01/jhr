 abstract = {Prior Go/NoGo studies have localized specific regions and EEG spectra for which traditional approaches have distinguished between Go and NoGo conditions. A more detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and timing of the synchronization of frequency bands would contribute substantially to the clarification of neural mechanisms that underlie performance of the Go/NoGo task. The present study used a machine learning approach to learn the features that distinguish between ERSPs involved in selection and inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. A neural network classifier was used to predict task conditions for each subject to characterize ERSPs associated with Go versus NoGo trials. The final model accurately identified individual task conditions at an overall rate of 92%, estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The detailed accounting of EEG time-frequency patterns localized to brain sources (i.e., thalamus, preSMA, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex) provides elaboration on previous findings from fMRI and EEG studies and more information about EEG power changes in multiple frequency bands (i.e., primarily theta power increase, alpha decreases, and beta increases and decreases) within these regions underlying the selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials. This extends previous findings, providing more information about neural mechanisms underlying selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials, respectively, and may offer insight into therapeutic uses of neuromodulation in neural dysfunction.},
