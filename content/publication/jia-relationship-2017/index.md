abstract: 'The ERP components and variations of spatial complexity or functional connectivity
  are two distinct dimensions of neurophysiological events in the visual Go/Nogo task.
  Extensive studies have been conducted on these two distinct dimensions; however,
  no study has investigated whether these two neurophysiological events are linked
  to each other in the visual Go/Nogo task. The relationship between spatial complexity
  of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, quantified by the measure omega complexity,
  and event-related potential (ERP) components in a visual Go/Nogo task was studied.
  We found that with the increase of spatial complexity level, the latencies of N1
  and N2 component were shortened and the amplitudes of N1, N2, and P3 components
  were decreased. The anterior Go/Nogo N2 effect and the Go/Nogo P3 effect were also
  found to be decreased with the increase of EEG spatial complexity. In addition,
  the reaction times in high spatial complexity trials were significantly shorter
  than those of medium and low spatial complexity trials when the time interval used
  to estimate the EEG spatial complexity was extended to 0âˆ¼1,000 ms after stimulus
  onset. These results suggest that high spatial complexity may be associated with
  faster cognitive processing and smaller postsynaptic potentials that occur simultaneously
  in large numbers of cortical pyramidal cells of certain brain regions. The EEG spatial
  complexity is closely related with demands of certain cognitive processes and the
  neural processing efficiency of human brain. NEW & NOTEWORTHY: The reaction times,
  the latencies/amplitudes of event-related potential (ERP) components, the Go/Nogo
  N2 effect, and the Go/Nogo P3 effect are linked to the electroencephalographic (EEG)
  spatial complexity level. The EEG spatial complexity is closely related to demands
  of certain cognitive processes and could reflect the neural processing efficiency
  of human brain. Obtaining the single-trial ERP features through single-trial spatial
  complexity may be a more efficient approach than traditional methods.'
